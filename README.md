# lithography_sim
Personal project to simulate a pattern on a 2D material such as a silicon wafer. 
The principal objective of this project is to start by creating a very simple pattern on a simulated wafer.
After completing this step I'm gonna be updatign the project to make it more user friendly and makeing it as personificable as it can be so each diferent user can
simulate its personal wafer with different patterns.
At some point I'm gonna be trying to print patterns designed by autoCAD to make this simulation as realistic as it can be. 

I also would like to implement a graphic interface to make it more easy to use.

Feel free to use this for your own projects but keep in mind I'm still a student and this is my first personal project and I'm very new at the semicons world and, to be fair, I'm also pretty new at coding :)
